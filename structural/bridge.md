## Bridge

#### BASIC DESCRIPTION:
- decouple an abstraction from its implementation
- abstraction provides high-level control logic. It relies on the implementation object to do the actual low-level work
- abstraction can only communicate with an implementation object via methods that are declared in abstraction
- help to create platform/framework independent classes and apps
- bridge in contrast to  Adapter pattern is something that we implement upfront 
- the Adapter makes things work after they're designed; Bridge makes them work before they are
