## Mediator

#### BASIC DESCRIPTION:
- reduce chaotic dependencies between objects
- reduce coupling between various components of a program
- restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object
- components must collaborate indirectly, by calling a special mediator object
- in result, the components depend only on a single mediator class instead of being coupled to dozens of their colleagues
- "one good friend is better than many"
- use the Mediator pattern when itâ€™s hard to change some of the classes because they are tightly coupled to a bunch of other classes
- use the Mediator when you find yourself creating tons of component subclasses just to reuse some basic behaviour in various contexts
- communication is extracted between various components into a single place, making it easier to comprehend and maintain
- the disadvantage is that the mediator can evolve into a God Object

{
    public function checkAvailability(int $id): bool;
    public function sendNotification(string $message): void;
